# ProfInsight

This project is a Java-based data parsing and visualization application. The tool processes a real-world dataset of nearly 20,000 professor reviews from RateMyProfessors.com and enables interactive exploration of trends in ratings, language usage, and gender-based patterns.

The project emphasizes hash table implementation, efficient data analysis, and event-driven visualization. Users can input keywords or categories through a JavaFX GUI to dynamically generate bar and line graphs representing different distributions in the data.
